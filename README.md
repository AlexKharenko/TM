# Task Manager

## This app is made using Vue.Js framework.

### Here you can manage your task. To change the status of a task, drag it to another column. If you want to edit the task, there is a button. One or both fields must not be empty for editing the task. If you want to group your tasks, you can choose a unique color for each group. It is black by default.
